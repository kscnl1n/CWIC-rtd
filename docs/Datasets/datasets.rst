Datasets
==========================

This tab shows all of the datasets you have uploaded or interacted with. 

.. note::
    **Point of confusion:**
    This is not a list of all datasets you can currently work with–these will be present in the history sidebar on the right. Instead, this is all of the datasets that have ‘passed through’ the CFDE workspace across all histories.

**Deleting datasets**
If you click the trash icon in your history tab, you will delete the dataset from your history, making it inaccessible to the current workflow. However, it will still exist on your disk allocation and will take up disk space. To completely delete a dataset from the disk allocation, you must purge it.

**Purging datasets**
To purge a dataset, you must first delete it from your history. Then, if you want to permanently remove the dataset from your storage quota:

1. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the History panel (top right of the history list).

2. Select “Purge Deleted Datasets” to free up space.

The amount of bytes you are using should change to reflect this in the top right:

*Example - this is an example of how many bytes are used. It will not necessarily reflect the amount of bytes that are in your CFDE allocation, though after purging a dataset, the amount of bytes you are using should decrease.
