Upload 
------
The upload bar allows you to upload datasets to the CFDE workspace. It is a convenient way to upload and access large datasets you need available on CFDE machines. 

For additional tutorials on running machine learning processes on these datasets, see **Creating Your Own Workflow.**


**Uploading a dataset**
To upload a dataset, click on Upload. There should be four options available to you:

- **Regular** – for uploading singular flat files (e.g., `.CSV`, `.TXT`, or `.FASTQ`)

  - You can choose to upload locally (from your machine) or remotely.
  - You can also try parsing/fetching the data from a web URL.

- **Composite** – for datasets made of multiple files but treated as one singular unit (e.g., `.bt2`, `.fa`)

  - These will also be immediately available under “Datasets”.

- **Collection** – for datasets composed of multiple files that need to be uploaded as separate datasets,
  such as in the case of pairs or lists (e.g., batch processing or sampling)

- **Rule-based upload** – for when you need advanced collections that are built dynamically with metadata in mind.

  For more information about uploading Rule-based datasets to the CFDE Galaxy, look here:

  For assistance troubleshooting data uploads, click the question mark in the upper right corner for community support.
