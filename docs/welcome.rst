Welcome to the CWIC Workspace!
=============================
Purpose
-------
The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) platform is a workspace where researchers can access High-Performance Computing (HPC) compute time for large-scale data analytics and machine learning projects, for free.
 Built in collaboration with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC’s) HPC systems and the NIH’s suite of scientific tools, it is meant to assist researchers in computationally-heavy task whilst offering the 
 functionality of several pre-developed research tools in the same suite.
